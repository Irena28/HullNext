Founders
We are Irena and Martin, two technology professionals, who relocated from Boston to Hull, MA in 2018. Recognizing the need for a centralized hub of information about our new home, we embarked on a mission to create the Hull Next website.
After exploring different parts of the world and living in various places across the U.S. and beyond, we picked Hull as our home. 
Together, with her husband Michael, they established Seaside Transport, a thriving business that caters to the bustling transportation needs of both locals and tourists.
Tara has BS degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing from Salve Regina University.
