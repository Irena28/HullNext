Julie, a licensed aesthetician, developed her side business while teaching middle school English in the Berkshires. Her part-time experience at a major Berkshire Resort and love for helping people supported her passion for developing her own skincare line and professional services. Now located in Hull, she offers luxury skincare products and services to selective clients.
After exploring different parts of the world and living in various places across the U.S. and beyond, we picked Hull as our home.
